                <div class="faq__question-answer">
                    <h4 class="faq__question">How does this work?</h4>
                    <p class="faq__answer">The hospital appointment system is designed to make the process of booking appointments quick, easy, and hassle-free. With our online system, patients can simply log in and select their preferred doctor or specialist, choose a convenient time and date, and make their appointment in just a few clicks. This eliminates the need for patients to wait on hold or stand in line, and allows them to schedule appointments at their own convenience.</p>

                <div class="faq__question-answer">
                    <h4 class="faq__question">How does this work?</h4>
                    <p class="faq__answer">Our hospital appointment system also provides patients with the ability to view their medical records and test results online. This means that patients can access their health information at any time, from anywhere, without having to visit the hospital in person. By providing easy access to medical records and test results, we aim to improve patient engagement and empower individuals to take control of their own health..</p>

                    <h4 class="faq__question">How does this work?</h4>
                    <p class="faq__answer">Another key feature of our hospital appointment system is the ability to send automatic appointment reminders to patients via email or SMS. This helps to reduce the number of missed appointments, which can be costly for both patients and healthcare providers. With our system, patients receive timely reminders about their upcoming appointments, ensuring that they don't forget and can make the necessary arrangements to attend..</p>

                    <p class="faq__answer">Finally, our hospital appointment system also offers a feedback mechanism for patients to share their experiences with healthcare providers. By collecting feedback, we aim to improve the quality of care provided and ensure that patients receive the best possible service. Our system allows patients to rate their experiences and provide comments, which can be used to identify areas for improvement and make changes that benefit both patients and healthcare providers..</p>
